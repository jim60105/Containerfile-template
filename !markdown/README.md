# Project Name

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jim60105/Containerfile-template/badge?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jim60105/Containerfile-template) [![GitHub Workflow Status (with event)](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/jim60105/Containerfile-template/scan.yml?label=IMAGE%20SCAN&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/jim60105/Containerfile-template/actions/workflows/scan.yml)

This is the docker image for [Source/Project: Project details.](https://github.com/source/Containerfile-template) from the community.

Get the Containerfile at [GitHub](https://github.com/jim60105/Containerfile-template), or pull the image from [ghcr.io](https://ghcr.io/jim60105/Containerfile-template) or [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/jim60105/Containerfile-template?tab=tags).

## Usage Command

Mount the current directory as `/output` and run Containerfile-template with additional input arguments.  
The downloaded files will be saved to where you run the command.

```bash
docker run -it -v ".:/output" ghcr.io/jim60105/Containerfile-template [options] [url]
```

The `[options]`, `[url]` placeholder should be replaced with the options and arguments for Containerfile-template. Check the [Containerfile-template README](https://github.com/source/Containerfile-template?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for more information.

You can find all available tags at [ghcr.io](https://github.com/jim60105/Containerfile-template/pkgs/container/Containerfile-template/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged) or [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/jim60105/Containerfile-template?tab=tags).

## Available tags

This repository contains three Containerfiles for building images based on different base images:

| Containerfile                                     | Base Image                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [alpine.Containerfile](alpine.Containerfile)         | [Python official image 3.11-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/)                                                              |
| [ubi.Containerfile](ubi.Containerfile)               | [Red Hat Universal Base Image 9 Minimal](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi9/ubi-minimal/615bd9b4075b022acc111bf5) |
| [distroless.Containerfile](distroless.Containerfile) | [Google Distroless python3-debian12](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)                                           |

And, built with the following code version of Containerfile-template: main branch, v2.2.0, v2.1.3.

| Code Version                                                                | Alpine                    | UBI          | Distroless          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| [main branch](https://github.com/source/Containerfile-template)                | `alpine`, `latest`        | `ubi`        | `distroless`        |
| [v2.2.0](https://github.com/source/Containerfile-template/releases/tag/v2.2.0) | `v2.2.0`, `v2.2.0-alpine` | `v2.2.0-ubi` | `v2.2.0-distroless` |
| [v2.1.3](https://github.com/source/Containerfile-template/releases/tag/v2.1.3) | `v2.1.3`, `v2.1.3-alpine` | `v2.1.3-ubi` | `v2.1.3-distroless` |

> [!TIP]
> I've notice that that both the UBI version and the Distroless version offer no advantages over the Alpine version. So _**please use the Alpine version**_ unless you have specific reasons not to. All of these base images are great, some of them were simply not that suitable for our project.

### Build Command

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Clone the Git repository recursively to include submodules:  
> `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jim60105/Containerfile-template.git`

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using an earlier version of the docker client, it is necessary to [enable the BuildKit mode](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/#getting-started) when building the image. This is because I used the `COPY --link` feature which enhances the build performance and was introduced in Buildx v0.8.  
> With the Docker Engine 23.0 and Docker Desktop 4.19, Buildx has become the default build client. So you won't have to worry about this when using the latest version.

For example, if you want to build the alpine image:

```bash
docker build -f alpine.Containerfile -t Containerfile-template:alpine .
```
