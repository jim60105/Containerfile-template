This repository collects all of my containerization works and serves as a template for quickly starting new projects. These files are extracted from my previous projects, they cannot be used directly. They preserve the unique configurations of the original projects, along with my personal preferences and coding style. Kindly exercise caution when using them.

## My works

| Repository | Description | Containerfile |
|--|--|--|
| [docker-whisperX](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-whisperX) | A Dockerfile and CI workflow focus on multi-stage building and optimal cache adjustment. It efficiently builds close to ***200*** Docker images, each with a size of ***10G,*** on a weekly basis using the GitHub free runner. | [🔗](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-whisperX/blob/master/Dockerfile) |
| [docker-stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-stable-diffusion-webui) | Python ML project containerization and Docker build CI workflow fully on the GitHub free runner. The main goal of designing this image is to keep it ***small and follow best practices.*** Successfully controlled the size to around ***10GB,*** saving approximately ***1/3*** of the capacity compared to other existing solutions. | [🔗](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-stable-diffusion-webui/blob/master/Dockerfile)|
| [docker-MSSQL-Server](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-MSSQL-Server) | A MSSQL Server Containerized Backup and Restoration Solution.
